React application designed to display detailed information about a specific show or episode. Its primary functionality includes rendering show details, allowing users to add episodes to their favorites list, and managing state to ensure a seamless user experience.

Component Overview
The ShowDetails component utilizes React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state and fetch data dynamically. It is structured to handle the following key functionalities:

State Management:

Favorites State: Maintains an array (favorites) using useState, storing episodes that users have marked as favorites.
Loading State: Manages loading state (loading) to indicate when data is being fetched.
Error State: Handles errors (error) that may occur during data retrieval.
Fetching Show Details:

Utilizes useEffect to asynchronously fetch show details based on the id parameter obtained from useParams(). This ensures that the component updates whenever the id changes, facilitating dynamic content rendering.
Displaying Show Details:

Renders show information such as title, season, and show title dynamically based on fetched data.
Provides a button (Add to Favorites) for users to add the current episode to their favorites list.
Adding to Favorites:

Implements addToFavorites function to add episodes to the favorites array. This function uses setFavorites to update state and localStorage for persistence across sessions.
Error Handling:

Includes conditional rendering for loading and error states to provide feedback to users during data fetching or in case of errors.
Persistence:

Uses localStorage to store and retrieve favorites array, ensuring that favorite episodes persist beyond the current session.
Functionality and Usage
The ShowDetails component enhances user interaction by:

Providing a clear and structured view of show details.
Enabling users to mark episodes as favorites with a single click.
Ensuring seamless integration with localStorage for persistent favorite management.
Handling loading and error states gracefully to maintain a smooth user experience.
Conclusion
The ShowDetails component exemplifies effective state management, dynamic data fetching, and user interaction design in a React application. By leveraging React hooks and local storage, it delivers a responsive and intuitive interface for users to explore, favorite, and manage episodes effortlessly.
